def find_difference(s , t)

end

find_difference("abcd", "baedc") # e

```

## Missing Number

Example 2:

Input: [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
Output: 8
```

### starter

```ruby

def missing_num(arr)

end

missing_num([3,0,1]) #2


missing_num([9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]) #8


```

## Story of Fry
Make a loop on the story array and print each element untill there are no longer any elements to print

    'The spaceship hits a wormhole and crashes in 1941 Roswell, NM',
