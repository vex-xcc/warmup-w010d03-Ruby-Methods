# Find the Difference

Given two strings s and t.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Find the letter that was added in t.

## Example:

```
Input:
s = "abcd"
t = "baedc"

Output: e

Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.
```

### starter

```ruby
s = "abcd"
t = "baedc"

def find_difference(s , t)
  for i in 0..(s.length)
  if s.chars.sort.join[i] != t.chars.sort.join[i]
   t.chars.sort.join[i]
  end
  end
   t.chars.sort.last
  end

  p find_difference(s , t) # e

```

## Missing Number

Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n, find the one that is missing from the array.

## Example 1:

```
Input: [3,0,1]
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
Output: 8
```

### starter

```ruby

def missing_num(arr)

end

missing_num([3,0,1]) #2


missing_num([9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]) #8


```

## Story of Fry
Make a loop on the story array and print each element untill there are no longer any elements to print


## Example 1:

```  

Output:
    'Fry is born without a delta brainwave',
    'As a result, Fry is cryogenically frozen until 2999',
    'In the future, Fry works on a spaceship',
    'The spaceship hits a wormhole and crashes in 1941 Roswell, NM',
    'Fry encounters his grandmother, then inadvertently sires his father'

```


### starter

```ruby
story = [
    'Fry is born without a delta brainwave',
    'As a result, Fry is cryogenically frozen until 2999',
    'In the future, Fry works on a spaceship',
    'The spaceship hits a wormhole and crashes in 1941 Roswell, NM',
    'Fry encounters his grandmother, then inadvertently sires his father'
]


def story_of_fry(story)
    
end

story_of_fry(story)
